# express-note-taker

## Description
For this challenge, we had to use express to create a note taker application. The user had to be able to create new notes, pull up old notes, and delete notes when no longer needed. We had to deploy the application to Heroku. Ive had trouble creating the routes this week and need to work on them further.
